# Stress-Pattern-Occurrence-in-English-Words
This is a personal analysis project about Stress Pattern Occurrence in English Words.

This project is intended to provide English learners with data that allows them to do a data-driven guess 
when encountering words that they aren't sure where to stress, as stress is important in English pronunciation.  

The stress pattern was based on The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.

The English words dataset was based on the “SubtlexUS” dataset.
